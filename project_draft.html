<h3>Primary Goal</h3>
<p>The primary goal of our site is to provide car rental services.</p>
<h3>Site structure</h3>
<p>We will have 11 pages on our website, adhering to the following overall structure.</p>

<h3>Customer Profile</h3>
<p>Our customers will come from a broad range of ages, cultural background and of both sexes.</p>
<p>This means we will have to have an intuitive and clean design, with clear structure and
navigation. One of our thougts is to implement interactive help-boxes, and have a structurally large
scaled site (text, components etc).</p>
<p>Additionally our site will be responsive, to allow accessibility from different platforms and devices.</p>
<h3>Multimedia content</h3>
<p>Our site will for the most part provide text and images, but embedded youtube videos of our rental cars will also
be a possibility.</p>
<h3>Interactivity</h3>
<p>We will use JavaScript to provide interactive hints and tips, expand dialog-boxes etc. We might also use AJAX-calls
to load pagelets in the background to allow quick interaction with the site, with less pageloads visible to the user.</p>
<h3>Content aquirement</h3>
<p>For the most part, we will write the text ourselves. Images and other media content will be &laquo;borrowed&raquo;
from wheverver Google Search leads us.</p>
<h3>What we learned from analysis</h3>
<p>The most prolific thing we saw was that even good sites have errors. And the bad sites are, well. Really really bad.</p>
<p>What content to promote, and what can be moved to a sub page, in addition to similar tips were taken into consideration
from <a href="http://www.europcar.com">Europcar</a>, as they are a leading brand in the industry.</p>
