                    <h4>Title:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Following the steps given at www.w3.org to evaluate the titles at www.lingscars.com we see  that the titles are too long and in some cases the titles do not even mach the site we have navigated to. An example of this is that when we navigate to "How it works" the title reads "Audi A4 leasing".
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Image/text alternatives:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Some of the images on the page has alt tags, but the majority does not. This is not following the HTML convention. Nothing will be displayed if the image isn´t loaded where there is no  alt tag. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Headings:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Using http://validator.w3.org/ to get an outline of the page and looking at the source code, we see that there is no consistency in the use of headings. The heading tags that are there typically three on each page does not have a meaningful hierarchy. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Contrast ratio:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Lingscars.com is an example of a noisy page. The use of colours and backgrounds is a complete mess. This makes the page hard to read. There is no indication in the menu bar telling the user which site he/she is on. And the use of animated gifs makes the navigation even harder. This webpage should come with an epileptic warning. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Resize text:</h4>
                    <p>
                        There is no scaling on the page. They have a mobile version of the site with the same design philosophy. However is is possible to zoom with your browser. Doing this the text will become larger and easier to read. On the other hand the page has a menu on the right hand   side which will obscure some of the site if you zoom.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Keyboard access and visual focus:</h4>
                    <p>
                        It is not impossible to navigate the site using only keyboard, but it is not practical at all. Every site under the domain lingscars.com is cluttered with information and with large amounts links. This makes navigating the page using only keyboard hard. Which item is in focus is not really visible due to all the colours and animated gifs.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Forms, labels and errors:</h4>
                    <p></p>
                    
                    <h4>Multimedia alternatives:</h4>
                    <p></p>
                    
                    <h4>Basic structure check</h4>

                    <h4>Title:</h4>
                    <p>Every page has a good descriptiv title, it gives us a brief overview of what the content of the current subsite will be. The titles also tells us the company name. Every page has a unique title.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Image/text alternatives:</h4>
                    <p>All the images that we have found on the webpage has an alt tag. This will result in a backup text string if the picture is not loaded for some reason.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Headings:</h4>
                    <p>When it comes to headings, Europcar has a semi correct hierarchy. The different sizes is not used directly togheter and there is no immediet logical structur to speak of. Europcar also uses very strange names for there header classes. The header class for the h2 tag has been given the name h3. This is quite confusing and very difficult to wrap ones head around.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Contrast ratio:</h4>
                    <p>As far as we can see, the page does not offer any controlpanel or menu that helps a user change the contrast on the website. This is not godd as i may be harder for some people to navigate. The site has very many different colors and the different blend of contrast around the site.</p>

                    <h4>Resize text:</h4>
                    <p>The website scales very good with both zoom, pinch to zoom and the mobile version of the site is good. This makes it easier for most people to use the site.</p>

                    <h4>Keyboard access and visual focus:</h4>
                    <p>The site is almost totaly unsusable without a mouce or a touchpad. You can only access two fields on the site using only the keyboard. The searchfield and the choose language field is available, but non of the links, images og login works at all with keyboard only.</p>

                    <h4>Forms, labels and errors:</h4>
                    <p>There is a lot of date and time fields which all has error handling with good feedback. The registration form has email and password validation. The labels are working good, and informs the users in a good way then there is an error.</p>

                    <h4>Multimedia alternatives:</h4>
                    <p>There is no multimedia on the page, and there is therefore no reason to check for the alt tag.</p>

                    <h4>Basic structure check</h4>
                    <p>After the CSS has been removed from the site, the structure is still somehow there. The page will not have any columns and the page will be very long, and the time it takes to find the information we are looking will take considreble longer to find.</p>

            <h3>Customer Profile</h3>
            <p>Our customers will come from a broad range of ages, cultural background and of both sexes.</p>
            <p>This means we will have to have an intuitive and clean design, with clear structure and
            navigation. One of our thougts is to implement interactive help-boxes, and have a structurally large
            scaled site (text, components etc).</p>
            <p>Additionally our site will be responsive, to allow accessibility from different platforms and devices.</p>
            <h3>Multimedia content</h3>
            <p>Our site will for the most part provide text and images, but embedded youtube videos of our rental cars will also
            be a possibility.</p>
            <h3>Interactivity</h3>
            <p>We will use JavaScript to provide interactive hints and tips, expand dialog-boxes etc. We might also use AJAX-calls
            to load pagelets in the background to allow quick interaction with the site, with less pageloads visible to the user.</p>
            <h3>Content aquirement</h3>
            <p>For the most part, we will write the text ourselves. Images and other media content will be &laquo;borrowed&raquo;
            from wheverver Google Search leads us.</p>
            <h3>What we learned from analysis</h3>
            <p>The most prolific thing we saw was that even good sites have errors. And the bad sites are, well. Really really bad.</p>
            <p>What content to promote, and what can be moved to a sub page, in addition to similar tips were taken into consideration
            from <a href="http://www.europcar.com">Europcar</a>, as they are a leading brand in the industry.</p>
