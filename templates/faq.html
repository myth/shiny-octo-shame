                A Frequently Asked Questions page is necessary if you’re selling something, providing a service, or giving information about a complex subject.
                It takes the guesswork away from your visitors who may have questions, and makes the experience that much easier.
                When designing a FAQ page, usability should be at the top of the list of criteria to meet – after all you don’t want it to turn into a black hole of information.
