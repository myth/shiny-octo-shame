        <h3>How to Create Useful 'About' Pages</h3>
        <p>A successful about page should help people understand who you are, what you do, and the roles of individuals or groups in your company so they know who to get in contact with and for what purpose.
            About pages can help your customers or clients get to know you better and what you do.
